        /* The variable 'name' is declared as 'var' so it global scope and can be used anywhere in the program and will have the same 
        value thoughout the program. The variable 'name' declared as 'let' has only local scope therefore it can only be used within {} */
        /* 'var' cannot be used everywhere in the program because it may cause alot of confucions whle debugging the program speccially
        in case the variable names are the same as shown the above example. */
